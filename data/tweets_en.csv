Klopp will be very keen on cutting out these silly losses next season.
We'd be in such a good position if we'd have won yesterday. 4 off 4th with a game in hand over the teams above us. Such a shame.
Probably our most frustrating loss of the season. Not sure how we lost it. SO many chances. Looked like we were 3 up through Allen.
